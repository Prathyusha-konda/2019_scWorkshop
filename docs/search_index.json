In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq provides quantitative measurements of the expression of every gene in a single cell. However, to analyze scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some of the underlying assumptions for the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid. In this course we will cover all steps of the scRNA-seq processing, starting from the raw reads coming off the sequencer. The course includes common analysis strategies, using state-of-the-art methods and we also discuss the central biological questions that can be addressed using scRNA-seq. 1.2 TARGETED AUDIENCE &amp; ASSUMED BACKGROUND This course is aimed at researchers and technical workers who are or will be analyzing scRNA-seq data. The material is suitable both for experimentalists who want to learn more about data-analysis as well as computational biologists who want to learn about scRNASeq methods. Examples demonstrated in this course can be applied to any experimental protocol or biological system. The requirements for this course are: 1. Working knowledge of unix (managing files, running programs) 2. Programming experience in R (writing a function, basic I/O operations, variable types, using packages). Bioconductor experience is a plus. 3. Familiarity with next-generation sequencing data and its analyses (using alignment and quantification tools for bulk sequencing data) 1.3 COURSE FORMAT The course will be delivered over the course of five days. Each day will include a lecture and laboratory component. The lecture will introduce the topics of discussion and the laboratory sessions will be focused on practical hands-on analysis of scRNA-seq data. These sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as applying these skills on your own to complete individual exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a group. Computing will be done using a combination of tools installed on the attendees laptop computer and web resources accessed via web browser. 1.4 Getting Started 1.5 SESSION CONTENT 1.5.1 Monday – Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 (lunch break-1 hr, 40 min of total coffee breaks) 1.5.1.1 Lecture 1 – scRNA-Seq experimental design (1 hour, Orr) Overview of course (intros, 20 min) General introduction: HCA/KCO overview Comparison of Bulk and single cell RNA-Seq Overview of available scRNA-seq technologies (10x) and experimental protocols scRNA-Seq experimental design and analysis workflow? 1.5.1.2 Lab 1 – Understanding sequencing raw data (Kirk, 1.5-2 hours) Lab based around data wrangling from public data repositories: get data from 10x website, single cell portal, from GEO (fastqs, counts) Shell and Unix commands to navigate directories, create folders, open files Raw file formats 1.5.1.3 Lecture 2 - Intro to Data processing: from bcl file to bam file (1 hour, Dana) scRNA-Seq processing workflow starting with choice of sequencer (NextSeq, HiSeq, MiSeq) / barcode swapping and bcl files Overview of Popular tools and algorithms Common single-cell analyses and interpretation Sequencing data: alignment and quality control Looking at cool things in alignment like where reads are, mutations, splicing 1.5.1.4 Lab 2 – Processing raw scRNA-Seq data (Dana, no R at this point) Data outputs from different scRNAseq technologies (10x, Smart-seq2) - process both?

I believe this is something very productive and helpful because it is a kind of wrap-up and brainstorming session. Normally, ppl love to talk and present something and in this way they/we can be 100% sure they really understood the different steps of the pipeline.

There are few requirements for uploading packages besides building and installing succesfully, hence documentation and support is often minimal and figuring how to use these packages can be a challenge it itself. CRAN is the default repository R will search to find packages to install: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) require(&quot;devtools&quot;) 7.1.2 Github Github isn’t specific to R, any code of any type in any state can be uploaded. There is no guarantee a package uploaded to github will even install, nevermind do what it claims to do. R packages can be downloaded and installed directly from github using the “devtools” package installed above. devtools::install_github(&quot;tallulandrews/M3Drop&quot;) Github is also a version control system which stores multiple versions of any package. By default the most recent “master” version of the package is installed. If you want an older version or the development branch this can be specified using the “ref” parameter: # different branch devtools::install_github(&quot;tallulandrews/M3D&quot;, ref=&quot;nbumi&quot;) # previous commit devtools::install_github(&quot;tallulandrews/M3Drop&quot;, ref=&quot;434d2da28254acc8de4940c1dc3907ac72973135&quot;) Note: make sure you re-install the M3Drop master branch for later in the course. 7.1.3 Bioconductor Bioconductor is a repository of R-packages specifically for biological analyses. It has the strictest requirements for submission, including installation on every platform and full documentation with a tutorial (called a vignette) explaining how the package should be used. Bioconductor also encourages utilization of standard data structures/classes and coding style/naming conventions, so that, in theory, packages and analyses can be combined into large pipelines or workflows. Bioconductor also requires creators to support their packages and has a regular 6-month release schedule. Make sure you are using the most recent release of bioconductor before trying to install packages for the course. ## &gt;= R 3.5.0 if (!requireNamespace(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) BiocManager::install(&quot;MAST&quot;, version = &quot;3.8&quot;) 7.1.4 Source The final way to install packages is directly from source. In this case you have to download a fully built source code file, usually packagename.tar.gz, or clone the github repository and rebuild the package yourself. Generally this will only be done if you want to edit a package yourself, or if for some reason the former methods have failed. install.packages(&quot;M3Drop_3.05.00.tar.gz&quot;, type=&quot;source&quot;) 7.2 Installation instructions: All the packages necessary for this course are available here. Starting from “RUN Rscript -e”install.packages(‘devtools’)&quot; “, run each of the commands (minus”RUN“) on the command line or start an R session and run each of the commands within the quotation marks. Note the ordering of the installation is important in some cases, so make sure you run them in order from top to bottom. 7.3 Data-types/classes R is a high level language so the underlying data-type is generally not important. The exception if you are accessing R data directly using another language such as C, but that is beyond the scope of this course. Instead we will consider the basic data classes: numeric, integer, logical, and character, and the higher level data class called “factor”. You can check what class your data is using the “class()” function. Aside: R can also store data as “complex” for complex numbers but generally this isn’t relevant for biological analyses. 7.3.1 Numeric The “numeric” class is the default class for storing any numeric data - integers, decimal numbers, numbers in scientific notation, etc… x = 1.141 class(x) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; y = 42 class(y) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; z = 6.02e23 class(z) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Here we see that even though R has an “integer” class and 42 could be stored more efficiently as an integer the default is to store it as “numeric”. If we want 42 to be stored as an integer we must “coerce” it to that class: y = as.integer(42) class(y) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; Coercion will force R to store data as a particular class, if our data is incompatible with that class it will still do it but the data will be converted to NAs: as.numeric(&quot;H&quot;) ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion ## [1] NA Above we tried to coerce “character” data, identified by the double quotation marks, into numeric data which doesn’t make sense, so we triggered (“threw”) an warning message. Since this is only a warning R would continue with any subsequent commands in a script/function, whereas an “error” would cause R to halt. 7.3.2 Character/String The “character” class stores all kinds of text data. Programing convention calls data containing multiple letters a “string”, thus most R functions which act on character data will refer to the data as “strings” and will often have “str” or “string” in it’s name. Strings are identified by being flanked by double quotation marks, whereas variable/function names are not: x = 5 a = &quot;x&quot; # character &quot;x&quot; a ## [1] &quot;x&quot; b = x # variable x b ## [1] 5 In addition to standard alphanumeric characters, strings can also store various special characters. Special characters are identified using a backlash followed by a single character, the most relevant are the special character for tab : \\t and new line : \\n. To demonstrate the these special characters lets concatenate (cat) together two strings with these characters separating (sep) them: cat(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, sep= &quot; &quot;) ## Hello World cat(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, sep= &quot;\\t&quot;) ## Hello World cat(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, sep= &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Hello ## World Note that special characters work differently in different functions. For instance the paste function does the same thing as cat but does not recognize special characters. paste(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, sep= &quot; &quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello World&quot; paste(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, sep= &quot;\\t&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello\\tWorld&quot; paste(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, sep= &quot;\\n&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello\\nWorld&quot; Single or double backslash is also used as an escape character to turn off special characters or allow quotation marks to be included in strings: cat(&quot;This \\&quot;string\\&quot; contains quotation marks.&quot;) ## This &quot;string&quot; contains quotation marks. Special characters are generally only used in pattern matching, and reading/writing data to files. For instance this is how you would read a tab-separated file into R. dat = read.delim(&quot;file.tsv&quot;, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;) Another special type of character data are colours. Colours can be specified in three main ways: by name from those available, by red, green, blue values using the rgb function, and by hue (colour), saturation (colour vs white) and value (colour/white vs black) using the hsv function. By default rgb and hsv expect three values in 0-1 with an optional fourth value for transparency. Alternatively, sets of predetermined colours with useful properties can be loaded from many different packages with RColorBrewer being one of the most popular. reds = c(&quot;red&quot;, rgb(1,0,0), hsv(0, 1, 1)) reds ## [1] &quot;red&quot; &quot;#FF0000&quot; &quot;#FF0000&quot; barplot(c(1,1,1), col=reds, names=c(&quot;by_name&quot;, &quot;by_rgb&quot;, &quot;by_hsv&quot;)) 7.3.3 Logical The logical class stores boolean truth values, i.e. TRUE and FALSE. It is used for storing the results of logical operations and conditional statements will be coerced to this class. Most other data-types can be coerced to boolean without triggering (or “throwing”) error messages, which may cause unexpected behaviour. x = TRUE class(x) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; y = &quot;T&quot; as.logical(y) ## [1] TRUE z = 5 as.logical(z) ## [1] TRUE x = FALSE class(x) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; y = &quot;F&quot; as.logical(y) ## [1] FALSE z = 0 as.logical(z) ## [1] FALSE Exercise 1 Experiment with other character and numeric values, which are coerced to TRUE or FALSE? which are coerced to neither? Do you ever throw a warning/error message? 7.3.4 Factors String/Character data is very memory inefficient to store, each letter generally requires the same amount of memory as any integer. Thus when storing a vector of strings with repeated elements it is more efficient assign each element to an integer and store the vector as integers and an additional string-to-integer association table. Thus, by default R will read in text columns of a data table as factors. str_vector = c(&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Carrot&quot;, &quot;Carrot&quot;, &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;) factored_vector = factor(str_vector) factored_vector ## [1] Apple Apple Banana Banana Banana Carrot Carrot Apple Banana ## Levels: Apple Banana Carrot as.numeric(factored_vector) ## [1] 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 1 2 The double nature of factors can cause some unintuitive behaviour. E.g. joining two factors together will convert them to the numeric form and the original strings will be lost. c(factored_vector, factored_vector) ## [1] 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 1 2 Likewise if due to formatting issues numeric data is mistakenly interpretted as strings, then you must convert the factor back to strings before coercing to numeric values: x = c(&quot;20&quot;, &quot;25&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;38&quot;, &quot;20&quot;, &quot;40&quot;, &quot;25&quot;, &quot;30&quot;) x = factor(x) as.numeric(x) ## [1] 1 3 2 5 1 6 3 4 as.numeric(as.character(x)) ## [1] 20 25 23 38 20 40 25 30 To make R read text as character data instead of factors set the environment option stringsAsFactors=FALSE. This must be done at the start of each R session. options(stringsAsFactors=FALSE) Exercise How would you use factors to create a vector of colours for an arbitrarily long vector of fruits like str_vector above? Answer 7.3.5 Checking class/type We recommend checking your data is of the correct class after reading from files: x = 1.4 is.numeric(x) ## [1] TRUE is.character(x) ## [1] FALSE is.logical(x) ## [1] FALSE is.factor(x) ## [1] FALSE 7.4 Basic data structures So far we have only looked at single values and vectors. Vectors are the simplest data structure in R. They are a 1-dimensional array of data all of the same type. If the input when creating a vector is of different types it will be coerced to the data-type that is most consistent with the data. x = c(&quot;Hello&quot;, 5, TRUE) x ## [1] &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; class(x) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Here we tried to put character, numeric and logical data into a single vector so all the values were coerced to character data. A matrix is the two dimensional version of a vector, it also requires all data to be of the same type. If we combine a character vector and a numeric vector into a matrix, all the data will be coerced to characters: x = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;) y = c(1, 2, 3) class(x) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; class(y) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; m = cbind(x, y) m ## x y ## [1,] &quot;A&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## [2,] &quot;B&quot; &quot;2&quot; ## [3,] &quot;C&quot; &quot;3&quot; The quotation marks indicate that the numeric vector has been coerced to characters. Alternatively, to store data with columns of different data-types we can use a dataframe. z = data.frame(x, y) z ## x y ## 1 A 1 ## 2 B 2 ## 3 C 3 class(z[,1]) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; class(z[,2]) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; If you have set stringsAsFactors=FALSE as above you will find the first column remains characters, otherwise it will be automatically converted to a factor. options(stringsAsFactors=TRUE) z = data.frame(x, y) class(z[,1]) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; Another difference between matrices and dataframes is the ability to select columns using the $ operator: m$x # throws an error z$x # ok The final basic data structure is the list. Lists allow data of different types and different lengths to be stored in a single object. Each element of a list can be any other R object : data of any type, any data structure, even other lists or functions. l = list(m, z) ll = list(sublist=l, a_matrix=m, numeric_value=42, this_string=&quot;Hello World&quot;, even_a_function=cbind) ll ## $sublist ## $sublist[[1]] ## x y ## [1,] &quot;A&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## [2,] &quot;B&quot; &quot;2&quot; ## [3,] &quot;C&quot; &quot;3&quot; ## ## $sublist[[2]] ## x y ## 1 A 1 ## 2 B 2 ## 3 C 3 ## ## ## $a_matrix ## x y ## [1,] &quot;A&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## [2,] &quot;B&quot; &quot;2&quot; ## [3,] &quot;C&quot; &quot;3&quot; ## ## $numeric_value ## [1] 42 ## ## $this_string ## [1] &quot;Hello World&quot; ## ## $even_a_function ## function (..., deparse.level = 1) ## .Internal(cbind(deparse.level, ...)) ## &lt;bytecode: 0x102bae238&gt; ## &lt;environment: namespace:base&gt; Lists are most commonly used when returning a large number of results from a function that do not fit into any of the previous data structures. 7.5 More information You can get more information about any R commands relevant to these datatypes using by typing ?function in an interactive session. 7.6 Bioconductor S4 Classes Introduction Object-Oriented Programming in R Role of S4 in Bioconductor S4 Basics S4 Classes S4 Generic Functions &amp; Methods S4 Exercises S4 Constraints Copy on Slot Modification Object Overhead Method Dispatch S4 Case Studies Slot-Oriented Virtual Class (eSet) Method-Oriented Virtual Class (Sequence) Multiple Inheritance &amp; Vectorization (CompressedIRangesList) Build or Reuse? (CompresssedIRangesList) Class Union &amp; Group Generic (Rle) 7.7 Grammer of Graphics (ggplot2) 7.7.1 What is ggplot2? ggplot2 is an R package designed by Hadley Wickham which facilitates data plotting. In this lab, we will touch briefly on some of the features of the package. If you would like to learn more about how to use ggplot2, we would recommend reading “ggplot2 Elegant graphics for data analysis”, by Hadley Wickham. 7.7.2 Principles of ggplot2 Your data must be a dataframe if you want to plot it using ggplot2. Use the aes mapping function to specify how variables in the dataframe map to features on your plot Use geoms to specify how your data should be represented on your graph eg. as a scatterplot, a barplot, a boxplot etc. 7.7.3 Using the aes mapping function The aes function specifies how variables in your dataframe map to features on your plot. To understand how this works, let’s look at an example: library(ggplot2) library(tidyverse) set.seed(1) counts &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(rpois(100, lambda = 10), ncol=10, nrow=10)) Gene_ids &lt;- paste(&quot;gene&quot;, 1:10, sep = &quot;&quot;) colnames(counts) &lt;- paste(&quot;cell&quot;, 1:10, sep = &quot;&quot;) counts&lt;-data.frame(Gene_ids, counts) counts ## Gene_ids cell1 cell2 cell3 cell4 cell5 cell6 cell7 cell8 cell9 cell10 ## 1 gene1 8 8 3 5 5 9 11 9 13 6 ## 2 gene2 10 2 11 13 12 12 7 13 12 15 ## 3 gene3 7 8 13 8 9 9 9 5 15 12 ## 4 gene4 11 10 7 13 12 12 12 8 11 12 ## 5 gene5 14 7 8 9 11 10 13 13 5 11 ## 6 gene6 12 12 11 15 8 7 10 9 10 15 ## 7 gene7 11 11 14 11 11 5 9 13 13 7 ## 8 gene8 9 12 9 8 6 14 7 12 12 10 ## 9 gene9 14 12 11 7 10 10 8 14 7 10 ## 10 gene10 11 10 9 7 11 16 8 7 7 4 ggplot(data = counts, mapping = aes(x = cell1, y = cell2)) Let’s take a closer look at the final command, ggplot(data = counts, mapping = aes(x = cell1, y = cell2)). ggplot() initialises a ggplot object and takes the arguments data and mapping. We pass our dataframe of counts to data and use the aes() function to specify that we would like to use the variable cell1 as our x variable and the variable cell2 as our y variable. Task 1: Modify the command above to initialise a ggplot object where cell10 is the x variable and cell8 is the y variable. Clearly, the plots we have just created are not very informative because no data is displayed on them. To display data, we will need to use geoms. 7.7.4 Geoms We can use geoms to specify how we would like data to be displayed on our graphs. For example, our choice of geom could specify that we would like our data to be displayed as a scatterplot, a barplot or a boxplot. Let’s see how our graph would look as a scatterplot. ggplot(data = counts, mapping = aes(x = cell1, y = cell2)) + geom_point() Now we can see that there doesn’t seem to be any correlation between gene expression in cell1 and cell2. Given we generated counts randomly, this isn’t too surprising. Task 2: Modify the command above to create a line plot. Hint: execute ?ggplot and scroll down the help page. At the bottom is a link to the ggplot package index. Scroll through the index until you find the geom options. 7.7.5 Plotting data from more than 2 cells So far we’ve been considering the gene counts from 2 of the cells in our dataframe. But there are actually 10 cells in our dataframe and it would be nice to compare all of them. What if we wanted to plot data from all 10 cells at the same time? At the moment we can’t do this because we are treating each individual cell as a variable and assigning that variable to either the x or the y axis. We could create a 10 dimensional graph to plot data from all 10 cells on, but this is a) not possible to do with ggplot and b) not very easy to interpret. What we could do instead is to tidy our data so that we had one variable representing cell ID and another variable representing gene counts, and plot those against each other. In code, this would look like: counts&lt;-gather(counts, colnames(counts)[2:11], key = &#39;Cell_ID&#39;, value=&#39;Counts&#39;) head(counts) ## Gene_ids Cell_ID Counts ## 1 gene1 cell1 8 ## 2 gene2 cell1 10 ## 3 gene3 cell1 7 ## 4 gene4 cell1 11 ## 5 gene5 cell1 14 ## 6 gene6 cell1 12 Essentially, the problem before was that our data was not tidy because one variable (Cell_ID) was spread over multiple columns. Now that we’ve fixed this problem, it is much easier for us to plot data from all 10 cells on one graph. ggplot(counts,aes(x=Cell_ID, y=Counts)) + geom_boxplot() Task 3: Use the updated counts dataframe to plot a barplot with Cell_ID as the x variable and Counts as the y variable. Hint: you may find it helpful to read ?geom_bar. Task 4: Use the updated counts dataframe to plot a scatterplot with Gene_ids as the x variable and Counts as the y variable. 7.7.6 Plotting heatmaps A common method for visualising gene expression data is with a heatmap. Here we will use the R package pheatmap to perform this analysis with some gene expression data we will name test. library(pheatmap) set.seed(2) test = matrix(rnorm(200), 20, 10) test[1:10, seq(1, 10, 2)] = test[1:10, seq(1, 10, 2)] + 3 test[11:20, seq(2, 10, 2)] = test[11:20, seq(2, 10, 2)] + 2 test[15:20, seq(2, 10, 2)] = test[15:20, seq(2, 10, 2)] + 4 colnames(test) = paste(&quot;Cell&quot;, 1:10, sep = &quot;&quot;) rownames(test) = paste(&quot;Gene&quot;, 1:20, sep = &quot;&quot;) pheatmap(test) Let’s take a moment to work out what this graphic is showing us. Each row represents a gene and each column represents a cell. How highly expressed each gene is in each cell is represented by the colour of the corresponding box. For example, we can tell from this plot that gene18 is highly expressed in cell10 but lowly expressed in cell1. This plot also gives us information on the results of a clustering algorithm. In general, clustering algorithms aim to split datapoints (eg.cells) into groups whose members are more alike one another than they are alike the rest of the datapoints. The trees drawn on the top and left hand sides of the graph are the results of clustering algorithms and enable us to see, for example, that cells 4,8,2,6 and 10 are more alike one another than they are alike cells 7,3,5,1 and 9. The tree on the left hand side of the graph represents the results of a clustering algorithm applied to the genes in our dataset. If we look closely at the trees, we can see that eventually they have the same number of branches as there are cells and genes. In other words, the total number of cell clusters is the same as the total number of cells, and the total number of gene clusters is the same as the total number of genes. Clearly, this is not very informative, and will become impractical when we are looking at more than 10 cells and 20 genes. Fortunately, we can set the number of clusters we see on the plot. Let’s try setting the number of gene clusters to 2: pheatmap(test, kmeans_k = 2) Now we can see that the genes fall into two clusters - a cluster of 8 genes which are upregulated in cells 2, 10, 6, 4 and 8 relative to the other cells and a cluster of 12 genes which are downregulated in cells 2, 10, 6, 4 and 8 relative to the other cells. Task 5: Try setting the number of clusters to 3. Which number of clusters do you think is more informative? 7.7.7 Principal Component Analysis Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses a transformation to convert a set of observations into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The transformation is carried out so that the first principle component accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible, and each following principle component accounts for the greatest amount of variance possible under the contraint that it must be orthogonal to the previous components. PCA plots are a good way to get an overview of your data, and can sometimes help identify confounders which explain a high amount of the variability in your data. We will investigate how we can use PCA plots in single-cell RNA-seq analysis in more depth in a future lab, here the aim is to give you an overview of what PCA plots are and how they are generated. Let’s make a PCA plot for our test data. We can use the ggfortify package to let ggplot know how to interpret principle components. library(ggfortify) Principal_Components&lt;-prcomp(test) autoplot(Principal_Components, label=TRUE) Task 6: Compare your clusters to the pheatmap clusters. Are they related? (Hint: have a look at the gene tree for the first pheatmap we plotted) Task 7: Produce a heatmap and PCA plot for counts (below): set.seed(1) counts &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(rpois(100, lambda = 10), ncol=10, nrow=10)) rownames(counts) &lt;- paste(&quot;gene&quot;, 1:10, sep = &quot;&quot;) colnames(counts) &lt;- paste(&quot;cell&quot;, 1:10, sep = &quot;&quot;) "],

We evaluated 36 approaches using experimental and synthetic data and found considerable differences in the number and characteristics of the genes that are called differentially expressed. Prefiltering of lowly expressed genes has important effects, particularly for some of the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data analysis. However, we found that bulk RNA-seq analysis methods do not generally perform worse than those developed specifically for scRNA-seq. We also present conquer, a repository of consistently processed, analysis-ready public scRNA-seq data sets that is aimed at simplifying method evaluation and reanalysis of published results. Each data set provides abundance estimates for both genes and transcripts, as well as quality control and exploratory analysis reports. (Soneson and Robinson 2018) Cells are the basic building blocks of organisms and each cell is unique. Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as an indispensable tool to dissect the cellular heterogeneity and decompose tissues into cell types and/or cell states, which offers enormous potential for de novo discovery. Single-cell transcriptomic atlases provide unprecedented resolution to reveal complex cellular events and deepen our understanding of biological systems. In this review, we summarize and compare single-cell RNA sequencing technologies, that were developed since 2009, to facilitate a well-informed choice of method. The applications of these methods in different biological contexts are also discussed. We anticipate an ever-increasing role of single-cell RNA sequencing in biology with further improvement in providing spatial information and coupling to other cellular modalities. In the future, such biological findings will greatly benefit medical research.

Given the special characteristics of scRNA-seq data, including generally low library sizes, high noise levels and a large fraction of so-called ‘dropout’ events, it is unclear whether DE methods that have been devel- oped for bulk RNA-seq are suitable also for scRNA-seq 11.3.2 Dimensionality Reduction 11.3.2.1 PCA 11.3.2.2 11.3.3 Clustering 11.3.3.1 Kmeans 11.3.3.2 Louvain 11.3.3.3 Probalistic (LDA) 11.3.4 Visualizing/Embedding 11.3.4.1 tSNE 11.3.4.2 UMAP References "],

Since 2014, more than 50 trajectory inference methods have been developed, each with its own set of methodological characteristics. As a result, choosing a method to infer trajectories is often challenging, since a comprehensive assessment of the performance and robustness of each method is still lacking. In order to facilitate the comparison of the results of these methods to each other and to a gold standard, we developed a global framework to benchmark trajectory inference tools. Using this framework, we compared the trajectories from a total of 29 trajectory inference methods, on a large collection of real and synthetic datasets. We evaluate methods using several metrics, including accuracy of the inferred ordering, correctness of the network topology, code quality and user friendliness. We found that some methods, including Slingshot (Street et al. 2018), TSCAN (Z. Ji and Ji 2016) and Monocle DDRTree (Trapnell et al. 2014), clearly outperform other methods, although their performance depended on the type of trajectory present in the data. Based on our benchmarking results, we therefore developed a set of guidelines for method users. However, our analysis also indicated that there is still a lot of room for improvement, especially for methods detecting complex trajectory topologies. Our evaluation pipeline can therefore be used to spearhead the development of new scalable and more accurate methods, and is available at github.com/dynverse/dynverse.

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 21.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 21.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 21.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 21.1: Here is a nice table!
